<Mod title="Combine Overwatch [Beta]" gameVersion="107" author="Isaglish" description="This mod adds the [b]Combine Overwatch[/b] from [b]Half-Life: Alyx[/b].

The mod is still work-in-progress and unfinished; lots of equipment, art, and models are still missing, however if you still wanna test out the mod, the Combine Ordinal, Combine Charger, Combine Grunts, and Metrocops are playable.

This mod is heavily focused on [b]Half-Life: Alyx[/b], stuff from the previous franchises may or may not get added.

Looking forward to your valuable feedback.
